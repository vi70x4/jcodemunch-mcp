"""Keyring-backed credential resolution for jcodemunch-mcp (P1.3).

The recommended install pattern places API keys and tokens directly in
``claude_desktop_config.json``, ``~/.claude/settings.json``, ``.mcp.json``,
or ``~/.code-index/config.jsonc``. That keeps the user experience simple
but means every secret named in an MCP env block is recoverable on a
compromised endpoint with a single file read.

This module is the opt-in alternative: any of the recognised credential
env vars may be set to ``"keyring:<name>"``, and the resolver rewrites
that value to the secret stored under that name in the system keyring at
server startup. After the rewrite, every existing ``os.environ.get(...)``
site reads the resolved value without code change.

Storage backend is whatever ``keyring`` selects: macOS Keychain,
Windows Credential Manager, the freedesktop Secret Service on Linux, or
any of the alternative backends documented in the keyring package.

Service name is ``"jcodemunch-mcp"``. Keep your secret names stable so
they survive reinstalls.

Public surface:

    resolve_credentials_in_env() -> None
        Walks the recognised credential env vars and rewrites
        ``keyring:NAME`` references in-place via ``os.environ``.
        Safe to call multiple times. Soft-fails (logs at WARNING and
        leaves the env var unchanged) if the keyring package isn't
        installed or the named secret is missing.

    list_recognised_env_vars() -> list[str]
        Returns the canonical list of env vars this module touches.

    get_keyring_source_for(env_var) -> str | None
        For diagnostic use (``config --check``): returns the keyring
        name a given env var was resolved from, or ``None`` if the env
        var was not keyring-sourced.

    keyring_set / keyring_get / keyring_delete / keyring_list
        Thin wrappers over the keyring library so the CLI doesn't need
        a direct dependency. Each raises ImportError if keyring isn't
        installed.

# jcodemunch-mcp — Project Brief

## Current State
- **Version:** 1.108.24 — `check_edit_safe` edit-safety preflight (tool count 82). Companion to `check_delete_safe`: where delete-safety asks "who breaks if this disappears," edit-safety asks "what's my regression risk if I modify it, and what must I preserve." Fuses signature impact (external/cross-repo importers) + cyclomatic complexity + test-coverage presence + runtime traffic → verdict (`safe_to_edit`/`untested`/`complexity_risk`/`signature_impact`/`runtime_critical`) + recommended_action + ranked blockers. Read-only. Reuses `check_delete_safe`'s canonical helpers (`_is_test_file`/`_resolve_target`/`_runtime_hits`/`_runtime_data_present`) rather than duplicating. Clean-room build of the useful kernel of contributor PR #315 (that PR requested-changes for hidden CI edits + duplication; this is the in-house version). Also folds in the dead-`_HTML_COMMENT_RE` cleanup. Shipped via GitHub-release wheel (PyPI still quarantined). New file `tools/check_edit_safe.py`; 6 tests in `test_check_edit_safe.py`.
- **v1.108.23:** Astro (.astro) language support; language count → 74. PR #311 (@gokhanozdemir): mixed-language `.astro` parsing follows the Razor recursive-delegation pattern (TS frontmatter + HTML template + `<script>`/`<style>` re-parsed via `parse_file()`); BOM/CRLF/malformed-fence hardening + offset-preserving HTML-comment masking factored into new `parser/astro_shared.py` (shared by extractor.py + imports.py); `lang=` inference, JSON/JSON-LD `<script>` skip, template `id=` constants, frontmatter ESM + template-component edges (`{specifier, names}`, Vue/Nuxt-consistent). `.astro` added to JS-like extension sets (imports/package_registry/hooks) + plan_refactoring patterns. **Shipped via the GitHub-release wheel channel — NOT PyPI** (quarantine still open, see incident memory); README/QUICKSTART/USER_GUIDE pinned wheel URLs bumped to v1.108.23. 4503 passed, 7 skipped. **Post-release cleanup (committed fe5c9c9, unreleased — rides the next release):** dropped the dead `_HTML_COMMENT_RE` in `imports.py` (unused once Astro comment masking moved into `astro_shared.mask_html_comments_keep_offsets`); no behavior change.
- **v1.108.22:** keyring credentials, metadata-only cache, init --minimal, docstring opt-out, git-SHA verification, sigstore release signing (also side-channeled during quarantine).
- **v1.108.20:** (#306 watcher fast-path applies all discovery filters via shared helper. Audit follow-up to #300/v1.108.19 — that fix added `extra_ignore_patterns` to the fast path; #306 inventoried the other filters still missing (gitignore, size cap, symlink protection, skip-dirs, secret/binary detection) and refactored both code paths through a single `_should_index_file(file_path, cfg, gitignore_specs)` helper in `src/jcodemunch_mcp/tools/index_folder.py`. Full walk grows `gitignore_specs` per subdir; fast path pre-loads the root-level `.gitignore` once at entry. Deletions intentionally bypass the filter set (a file indexed before its ignore rule existed should still be removable). Documented fast-path tradeoffs: root-level .gitignore only, no package.json size-cap exemption, no binary sniff. 5 new regression tests in `TestFastPathHonorsAllDiscoveryFilters`; 232 passed across the indexing surface.)
- **v1.108.19:** watcher fast-path honors `extra_ignore_patterns`; #300 follow-up reported by @domis86 on v1.108.18. Full-walk index correctly skipped ignored files; the watcher fast path in `index_folder` skipped `discover_local_files` for performance and never applied the pathspec filter, so a modify event on an ignored file re-indexed it. Fix: compute `effective_extra` + `_fast_extra_spec` at fast-path entry, filter changed/added events in the classification loop; deletions pass through so previously-indexed files can still be removed. 3 regression tests. Broader audit at #306 (resolved in v1.108.20).
- **v1.108.18:** summarizer runtime honors project config; closes #304. Threads `repo=` from `summarize_symbols(symbols, use_ai, repo)` → `_create_summarizer(repo)` → provider `__init__` → `_config.get(..., repo=self.repo)`. `BaseSummarizer` gained `repo: Optional[str] = None` field inherited by Anthropic/Gemini/OpenAI subclasses. `get_model_name(repo=)` and `get_provider_name(repo=)` also accept the kwarg. Callers updated: `_indexing_pipeline.py` (3 sites), `index_folder.py` (2 sites + deferred summarize daemon), `summarize_repo.py` (1 site, passes `index.source_root`). Display in `_run_config` reverts to clean `[project]` tag since runtime now honors project overrides — the v1.108.17 "see #304" warning is removed. 5 new regression tests; 23 unrelated test lambdas updated for forward-compat with the new `repo=` kwarg.)
- **v1.108.17:** `config --check` now reflects `summarizer_model` config; surfaced by @slazarov on #300. Display formerly only consulted `OPENAI_MODEL` env + hardcoded default, so a configured `summarizer_model` was invisible. Fix: new `summarizer_model` row reads `_GLOBAL_CONFIG` directly (mirrors `batch_summarize.py` runtime — bypasses v1.108.15 project-aware shim for keys the runtime doesn't honor per-repo); provider MODEL rows (ANTHROPIC_MODEL / GOOGLE_MODEL / OPENAI_MODEL) consult `summarizer_model` first matching runtime resolution order. Honesty gate: when project-only `summarizer_model` is detected, display surfaces a `[project] (not honored by runtime — see #304)` warning instead of pretending the project value applies. #304 filed for the runtime fix to make `batch_summarize.py` pass `repo=` and honor project overrides. 3 new tests in `TestSummarizerModelDisplay`.)
- **v1.108.16:** `resolve_repo` cold-start hang in large-worktree envs, #303 follow-up by @rknighton against v1.108.15. v1.108.14 fixed the O(N) common-dir scan but missed an earlier path: provisional repo_id computation still routed through `resolve_index_identity` → `detect_git_root` → `_read_origin_url` when `git_root_identity=true`, and the subprocess `git config --get remote.origin.url` hung in the 130-worktree fixture. Three fixes: canonical-candidate discovery now runs BEFORE the slow path (new `match_path: "canonical_candidate_fast"` return); new `_local_provisional_repo_id` helper bypasses git identity entirely for not-indexed branch; `_read_origin_url` hardened with `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL` + `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM`/`GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null`/`GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` env-neutralisation matching `_git_toplevel`. 3 new tests; #277 worktree-canonical discovery preserved.
- **v1.108.15:** `config --check` honors `.jcodemunch.jsonc`, surfaced by @slazarov as a #300 follow-up on v1.108.14. The v1.108.12 fix made the file load and validate; this fix makes the printed config rows reflect the merged project values. `_run_config` probes cwd for `.jcodemunch.jsonc` at entry, loads it, and routes all 33 `_cfg.get()` display calls through a lightweight project-aware shim that injects `repo=cwd`. `_detect_source` gains a "project" tier that takes precedence over "config"; overridden rows now read `[project]`. "Config File" section reports `.jcodemunch.jsonc loaded from cwd: <path> (N key(s) override global)`. 3 new tests in `TestConfigDisplayHonorsProjectOverride`.
- **v1.108.14:** `resolve_repo` perf at scale, #303, reported by @rknighton with root-cause + local patch + before/after timings. Two cost sinks: `_find_canonical_candidates` spawned one `git rev-parse` subprocess per indexed repo (4-8s of process churn on Windows at 40 indexes), and `_compute_repo_id(store=store)` walked the whole index store via `_existing_git_identity` for path-containment checks on every candidate. Fixed: `_git_common_dir_cheap` reads `.git`/`commondir` directly (100-1000x faster than the subprocess); pre-fetch `store.list_repos()` once and try exact source_root match + source_root containment fast paths before the legacy compute-then-inspect; not-indexed final case skips the `store=` walk. Wire shape adds `_meta.match_path` (additive). Reporter's env: 120s timeout → ~0.149s for worktree resolve. 10 new tests; #277 worktree-canonical discovery preserved bit-for-bit.
- **v1.108.13:** project-config plumbing audit, #301, follow-up to #300. Audit of all `_config.get()` reads under `src/jcodemunch_mcp/tools/`; 9 sites in 5 files were missing `repo=` and silently ignoring `.jcodemunch.jsonc` overrides for keys including `redact_source_root`, `gitignore_warn_threshold`, `context_providers`, `staleness_days`, `file_tree_max_files`, `max_results`, and SQL-provider language gating. All fixed and annotated with `Project-overridable (#301)` markers. 4 global-by-design sites annotated as such. 1 regression test in `tests/test_tools.py`. No behavior change for users not using project config.
- **v1.108.12:** `.jcodemunch.jsonc` `extra_ignore_patterns` now honored (#300, reported by @domis86 with a clean Claude-assisted diagnosis). `get_extra_ignore_patterns()` in `security.py:337` was reading global config without `repo=`, so project-level overrides loaded into `_PROJECT_CONFIGS` were silently dropped at discovery time. Added `repo=` plumbing; `discover_local_files()` now forwards `str(folder_path)`. `config --check` also probes cwd for `.jcodemunch.jsonc` and validates if present, closing the "file not mentioned = was it loaded?" diagnostic gap. 2 new tests.
- **v1.108.11:** Drift cleanup + Windows-CI test hardening. Config template gained `list_workspaces` (was missing from the embedded all_tools list since v1.108.0); `test_wait_seconds_polls_until_lock_released` release-delay + elapsed ceiling bumped to absorb Windows-runner jitter (one CI flake confirmed-on-rerun on v1.108.10); README recency block regenerated. No behavior change.
- **v1.108.10:** Schema budget cleanup. `index_folder` had drifted from 213 to 406 tokens (v1.108.0 `paths` arg + v1.108.6 `identity_mode` arg absorbed use-case prose into schema). Trimmed those descriptions plus the `use_ai_summaries` provider-list (also in `index_file`); `core_compact` back to 3977 (under the 4000 v2 success-criterion line). Baseline updated for all six profiles. No behavior change.
- **v1.108.9:** Escape hatch for `_UNDISABLEABLE_TOOLS` (#299, requested by @kecsap as the follow-up offered when shipping #298). New config key `allow_disabling_tier_controls` (default `false`); when `true`, `disabled_tools` may include `set_tool_tier` and `announce_model`. Useful for hard tool-count caps like Antigravity's 50-tool limit, at the cost of in-session tier switching. Threaded through both enforcement sites (`list_tools` schema filter + `call_tool` project-level rejection). 4 new tests; pre-1.108.9 behavior preserved bit-for-bit when the flag is unset.
- **v1.108.8:** `jcodemunch_guide` honors `disabled_tools` (#298, reported by @kecsap). Split the always-present guarantee: `_ALWAYS_PRESENT_TOOLS` survives tier filtering (so core/standard tiers keep all three meta tools), but only the new `_UNDISABLEABLE_TOOLS = {set_tool_tier, announce_model}` survives `disabled_tools`. `jcodemunch_guide` is a documentation snippet, not a runtime control surface, so user opt-out via `disabled_tools` is honored at both schema visibility and call-time rejection.
- **v1.108.7:** Windows hook path fix: `_hook_invocation()` now emits forward-slash paths on Windows so Claude Code's bash launcher doesn't eat the backslashes (`C:\Python314\Scripts\...EXE` → `C:Python314Scripts...EXE` and "command not found"). `_merge_hooks()` deduplication now compares jcm subcommands via a new `_extract_jcm_subcommand()` regex instead of substring matching — absolute-path and bare forms of the same hook are correctly recognised as duplicates, ending the every-init-appends-another-copy bug. 19 new regression tests in `tests/test_init_hooks_paths.py`.
- **v1.108.6:** Local-first index identity restored as default — `resolve_index_identity()` in `storage/git_root.py` is the single source of truth for local-path → repo-ID resolution. Default is `local/<basename>-<hash>`; `identity_mode: "git"` opt-in enables git-root identity + monorepo subdir merging. Existing indexes of either kind are preserved automatically, with `IdentityModeConflict` / `IdentityModeAmbiguous` guarding silent re-keying. Plus: `check_delete_safe` now caveats `safe_to_delete` verdicts when no runtime traces have been ingested for the repo — honest-hint pattern back-ported from `check_column_drop_safe` in jdatamunch-mcp v1.8.0. PR #295 by @MariusAdrian88.
- **INDEX_VERSION:** 16
- **Tests:** 4509 passed, 7 skipped (1.108.24 — full count varies by optional-dep availability)
- **Python:** >=3.10
- **Tool count:** 82 (1.108.24 adds `check_edit_safe`)

Phase 5: optional stack_frequency block reading runtime_stack_events over a 30-day window — per-severity counts + first/last seen; narrative gains an appended sentence when error count >= 3
    get_pr_risk_profile.py    # get_pr_risk_profile: unified PR/branch risk assessment — fuses blast radius + complexity + churn + test gaps + volume into composite score. Phase 7: when runtime traces have been ingested, adds a 6th signal (runtime_traffic; W=0.15 with the static five rebalanced to 0.85 of their original weights) plus a runtime_dark_code_introduced flag for PRs that add code in files with zero runtime evidence. Static-only callers (no traces) keep the historical 5-signal mix bit-for-bit.
    get_hotspots.py           # get_hotspots: top-N high-risk symbols by complexity x churn
    get_repo_map.py           # get_repo_map: query-less, token-budgeted, signature-level repo overview ranked by PageRank — cold-start orientation. Reuses cached PageRank, emits signatures only (no bodies), greedy-packs per-file under token_budget

BM25 inverted-index pre-filter for sub-N^2 cost. Skips tests/dunders/generated by default.
    get_group_contracts.py    # get_group_contracts: cross-repo shared-symbol API surface for a group of indexed repos. Resolves named imports through the package registry, classifies each shared symbol into 4 verdict tiers (de_facto_api / leaky_internal / dead_contract / version_skew), attaches stability score (churn-weighted), last_breaking_change (from provenance), and runtime_hits (when traces exist). Pairs with get_cross_repo_map: that gives repo-level edges; this zooms in to the symbol-level surface.
    find_implementations.py   # find_implementations: multi-source concrete-impl discovery for interfaces/abstracts/methods. Four resolution channels with confidence scoring — LSP dispatch (1.0), AST class hierarchy (0.85), duck-typed name match (0.65), decorator handler (0.45). Classifies each impl (subclass_override / interface_impl / duck_typed / decorator_handler / subclass), ranks by PageRank × byte_length, attaches differs_by breakdown, optional cross_repo discovery.
    check_delete_safe.py      # check_delete_safe: composite preflight — can this symbol be deleted? Combines find_importers (cross_repo) + check_references + find_dead_code + runtime evidence + entry-point heuristics into a single verdict (safe_to_delete / test_coverage_only / internal_only / internal_uses_blocking / external_uses_blocking / cross_repo_blocking / runtime_observed / entry_point) plus top-5 blockers ranked by severity plus a one-line recommended_action. Read-only. Pairs with check_rename_safe for the rename-and-delete refactor flows. v1.104.1: track test_import_count separately from external_import_count so test-only consumption correctly downgrades to test_coverage_only. v1.108.6: honest-hint caveat — when `safe_to_delete` is reached AND `include_runtime=True` AND no traces are ingested for the repo (`_runtime_data_present()` returns False), the `recommended_action` surfaces that the verdict rests on static signals only and points at `import-trace`. `signals.runtime_data_present` surfaced for callers to introspect. Back-ported from `check_column_drop_safe` in jdatamunch-mcp v1.8.0.
    assemble_task_context.py  # assemble_task_context: task-aware single-call context orchestrator. Auto-classifies the task into one of six intents (explore/debug/refactor/extend/audit/review) via keyword scoring, auto-extracts anchor symbol names from the task, runs the intent-appropriate sub-tool sequence (digest + hotspots + tectonic for explore; anchor + callers + callees + blast + runtime for debug; anchor + rename_safe + delete_safe + implementations + similar for refactor; anchor + implementations + similar + decorators for extend; anchor + risk + blast + dead_code + untested for audit; changed + blast + risk + similar_changed for review), packs results into a single source-attributed capsule under token_budget. Each entry tagged with stage + source_tool. Intent classification is explainable (returns intent_keywords_matched + intent_confidence). Caller can override intent and include to force specific stages.

    get_project_intel.py      # get_project_intel: auto-discover+parse non-code knowledge (Dockerfiles, CI configs, compose, K8s, .env templates, Makefiles, scripts); cross-references to code symbols; 6 categories. v1.108.0 adds `scope_path` arg to restrict discovery to a monorepo subpath (use list_workspaces.path values); validates against source_root (traversal/absolute/non-existent all error).
    list_workspaces.py        # (v1.108.0) Enumerate monorepo workspace members. Detects pnpm (pnpm-workspace.yaml), yarn/npm (package.json `workspaces:`), turborepo (turbo.json), lerna (lerna.json), rush (rush.json), Go (go.work `use (...)`, module name from go.mod), Cargo (Cargo.toml `[workspace] members`). Returns `[{path, package_name, manager}, ...]` plus `is_monorepo` + `managers`. Read-only, dependency-free (hand-rolled minimal TOML/YAML readers).
    get_repo_health.py        # get_repo_health: one-call triage snapshot (delegate aggregator); includes six-axis `radar` field (v1.87.0)
    health_radar.py           # Six-axis health radar (complexity/dead_code/cycles/coupling/test_gap/churn_surface) + diff_health_radar pure-function tool for PR-time diff-grade reporting (v1.87.0). Phase 7 (v1.100.0): optional 7th axis runtime_coverage when caller passes runtime_coverage_pct; axis is omitted otherwise so the composite stays comparable against pre-Phase-7 baselines. diff_radar walks the axes dict generically — picks up the new axis automatically.

    __init__.py          # Trace ingestion package (Phases 0-5): re-exports redact_trace_record, resolve_to_symbol_id, parse_otel_file, ingest_otel_file, OtelSpan, parse_sql_log_file, ingest_sql_log_file, SqlQueryRecord, parse_stack_log_file, ingest_stack_log_file, StackEvent, StackFrame, VALID_SOURCES = {'otel','sql_log','stack_log','apm'}
    redact.py            # Single chokepoint redact_trace_record(record, source) — strips emails, IPv4, SQL literals/numerics, JSON value blocks, Python locals reprs, plus all secret patterns from ../redact.py
    resolve.py           # resolve_to_symbol_id(conn, file, line, name) — best-effort (file, line, function) → symbol_id with suffix-match fallback for absolute trace paths against repo-relative index paths
    otel.py              # Phase 1 OTel JSON parser — handles JSON-Lines, single-document JSON, top-level array, and .gz transparently; extracts code.filepath / code.lineno / code.function / duration into OtelSpan
    ingest.py            # Phase 1 orchestrator ingest_otel_file(db_path, file_path, redact_enabled, max_rows) — parse → redact → resolve → upsert; computes per-batch p50/p95 from span durations; FIFO-evicts runtime_calls + runtime_unmapped down to max_rows when exceeded; persists per-pattern redaction counts to runtime_redaction_log
    sql_log.py           # Phase 4 SQL log parser — pg_stat_statements CSV (header autodetect; total_time/total_exec_time + mean_time/mean_exec_time aliases) + generic JSON-Lines (.jsonl/.json/.log) + top-level array fallback + .gz transparent; extracts table refs (FROM/JOIN/UPDATE/INSERT INTO/DELETE FROM/MERGE INTO; schema-qualified names → trailing ident) and column refs (qualified alias.col + bare idents in SELECT/WHERE/ON/HAVING/GROUP BY/ORDER BY)
    sql_ingest.py        # Phase 4 orchestrator ingest_sql_log_file(db_path, file_path, redact_enabled, max_rows) — parse → redact → resolve → upsert; resolver builds a one-shot read-only metadata snapshot (file-stem map, exact-name map, dbt_columns/sqlmesh_columns set); upserts runtime_calls + runtime_columns + runtime_unmapped + runtime_redaction_log under source='sql_log'; FIFO-evicts all three runtime tables
    stack_log.py         # Phase 5 stack-frame parser — Python tracebacks (`File "...", line N, in <name>` pairs), JVM tracebacks (`at pkg.Class.method(File.java:N)` + flattened `Caused by:` chains), Node.js stacks (named `at funcName (file.js:N:N)` + anonymous `at file.js:N:N` + node:events-style module paths). Plain-text + JSON-Lines structured-log + top-level array + .gz. Severity heuristic: looks 3 lines back for FATAL/CRITICAL/ERROR/WARN[ING]/INFO; default 'info'.
    stack_ingest.py      # Phase 5 orchestrator ingest_stack_log_file(db_path, file_path, redact_enabled, max_rows) — parse → redact (event.message) → resolve each frame → upsert; populates BOTH runtime_calls (severity-agnostic rollup so confidence-stamping fires) AND runtime_stack_events (per-severity counts). FIFO-evicts runtime_calls + runtime_unmapped + runtime_stack_events. Phase 6 adds ingest_stack_log_stream() that takes an in-memory text payload via the shared _ingest_stack_iter() pipeline.
    http_routes.py       # Phase 6 Starlette route handlers: POST /runtime/otel, POST /runtime/sql, POST /runtime/stack. Off by default — gated by runtime_ingest_enabled config + JCODEMUNCH_HTTP_TOKEN bearer auth. Per-repo asyncio.Lock serialises writes against the same SQLite DB. Body cap (default 5 MB) checked separately for on-wire and decompressed sizes (gzip-bomb guard). Repo selection via X-JCM-Repo header or ?repo= query. Mounted on both SSE and streamable-http transports.
    confidence.py        # Phase 2 RuntimeConfidenceProbe + attach_runtime_confidence (symbol-keyed) + attach_runtime_confidence_by_file (file-keyed). Stamps `_runtime_confidence` ∈ {confirmed, declared_only, unmapped} on result entries; emits `_meta.runtime_freshness` summary. Read-only connections use ?mode=ro&immutable=1 so they never bump WAL mtime and invalidate the CodeIndex LRU cache. Zero-cost when runtime_calls is empty.

    find_unused_paths.py     # Phase 3 + 4: symbols with zero/stale runtime hits over the window. Excludes test files and entry-point filenames by default. Refuses when runtime_calls is empty (would trivially flag everything). Phase 4 dbt-aware extension: when context_metadata has *_columns + runtime_columns has rows, rescues SQL-file model symbols that have observed column reads (column-only audit-log shape) and surfaces dbt models whose declared columns have zero hits with reason='dbt_model_no_column_reads' + unused_columns list.
    get_redaction_log.py     # Phase 6: forensic accounting of PII redactions — surfaces per-pattern counts from runtime_redaction_log so operators can verify the redaction chokepoint is firing on production traffic. Filters by source + since_days. Read-only / immutable connection.
  retrieval/
    confidence.py        # compute_confidence/attach_confidence: 0-1 retrieval confidence score (geometric mean of gap, strength, identity, freshness sub-signals); attached to _meta.confidence on search_symbols / plan_turn / get_ranked_context
    freshness.py         # FreshnessProbe: per-result _freshness classification (fresh / edited_uncommitted / stale_index); compares index SHA vs git HEAD + per-file mtime vs CodeIndex.file_mtimes; wired into search_symbols / get_symbol_source / get_context_bundle / get_ranked_context
    tuning.py            # WeightTuner + get_semantic_weight: learns per-repo ranking weights from v1.78.0 ranking_events ledger; ±0.05 step on semantic_weight (clamp 0.1-0.8) and identity_boost (clamp 0.5-2.0) when mean confidence between groups differs by ≥0.05; persists to ~/.code-index/tuning.jsonc; applied at query time when caller leaves semantic_weight at the default
    embed_drift.py       # CANARY_STRINGS (16) + capture_canary/check_drift: pins canary embeddings to ~/.code-index/embed_canary.json, re-checks cosine drift via check_embedding_drift MCP tool; catches silent provider model changes (Gemini/OpenAI/bundled-ONNX); default threshold 0.05 cosine distance

## CLI Subcommands
| Subcommand | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `serve` (default) | Run the MCP server (`stdio`, `sse`, or `streamable-http`) |
| `init` | Interactive one-command onboarding: detect MCP clients, write config, install CLAUDE.md policy, hooks, index |
| `install <agent>` | (v1.105.1) Per-agent shortcut over `init`; targets: `claude-code`, `claude-desktop`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `continue`, `all`. `install --list` enumerates; `install --status` reports state (JSON via `--json`). **v1.107.0:** `--skills` also emits the Claude Agent Skill bundle (`~/.claude/skills/jcodemunch/SKILL.md` by default; `--skills-scope project` for project-local) |
| `install-status` | (v1.105.1) Read-only report of which clients / policies / hooks currently have jcodemunch wired; `--json` for scripting. **v1.107.0:** also reports `skills.global.present` and `skills.project.present` |
| `uninstall [target]` | (v1.105.1) Reverse `init` / `install`. Preserves user-authored hook rules and content outside our policy region; removes files only when empty after stripping. `--keep-claude-md`, `--keep-hooks`, etc. scope what's reversed |
| `watch <paths>` | File watcher — auto-reindex on change |
| `watch-claude` | Auto-discover and watch Claude Code worktrees |
| `watch-all` | Auto-discover **every** locally-indexed repo and keep it fresh; rediscovers on interval |
| `watch-install` | Install `watch-all` as a login service (systemd / launchd / Task Scheduler) |
| `watch-uninstall` | Remove the installed `watch-all` login service |
| `watch-status` | Print service state + per-repo reindex status (also exposed as MCP tool `get_watch_status`) |
| `hook-event create\|remove` | Record a worktree lifecycle event (called by Claude Code hooks) |
| `index [target]` | Index a local folder (default: `.`) or GitHub repo (`owner/repo`). One command, no init required |
| `index-file <path>` | Re-index a single file within an existing indexed folder (used by PostToolUse hooks) |
| `import-trace [--otel <path> \| --sql-log <path> \| --stack-log <path>] [--repo <id>] [--no-redact]` | (Phases 1 + 4 + 5) Ingest a runtime trace file into the runtime_* tables. `--otel` takes JSON / JSON-Lines / .gz and maps spans by `(code.filepath, code.lineno, code.function)`; `--sql-log` takes pg_stat_statements CSV or generic SQL JSON-Lines and maps queries by referenced tables + dbt/SQLMesh column metadata; `--stack-log` takes plain-text app log or JSON-Lines record set with Python / JVM / Node.js tracebacks and writes severity-tagged frame counts to runtime_stack_events. Redacts PII at the chokepoint by default. Pass exactly one source flag. |
| `config` | Print effective configuration grouped by concern |
| `config --check` | Also validate prerequisites (storage writable, AI pkg installed, HTTP pkgs present) |
| `config --upgrade` | Add missing keys from current template to existing config.jsonc, preserving user values |
| `download-model` | Download bundled ONNX embedding model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for zero-config semantic search; `--target-dir` override |
| `install-pack [id]` | Download and install a Starter Pack pre-built index; `--list` for catalog, `--license KEY` for premium |
| `hook-pretooluse` | PreToolUse hook: intercept Read on large code files, suggest jCodemunch (reads JSON stdin) |
| `hook-posttooluse` | PostToolUse hook: auto-reindex files after Edit/Write (reads JSON stdin) |
| `hook-precompact` | PreCompact hook: generate session snapshot before context compaction (reads JSON stdin) |
| `hook-taskcomplete` | TaskCompleted hook: post-task diagnostics — dead code, untested symbols, dangling refs (reads JSON stdin) |
| `hook-subagent-start` | SubagentStart hook: inject condensed repo orientation for spawned agents (reads JSON stdin) |
| `whatsnew` | Refresh README recency block + write `whatsnew.json` from `CHANGELOG.md` (release flow) |
| `receipt` | Token-economy ledger from Claude transcripts — modeled tokens-saved + dollar value at Sonnet/Opus/Haiku rates; `--explain`, `--export csv\|json`, `--days`, `--model` |
| `digest` | Agent stand-up briefing — composes since-last-session delta + risk surface + dead-code candidates; tracks per-repo last-seen SHA at `~/.code-index/digest_state/`; also exposed as MCP tool `digest` |
| `health` | Print `get_repo_health` JSON to stdout (includes six-axis radar). For CI/scripting; `--radar-only` for just the radar sub-field. Used by the v1.88.0 health-radar GitHub Action |
| `file-risk` | Print per-symbol risk JSON for a file (composite score + four-axis breakdown). Used by the v0.2.0 VS Code risk-density gutter |
| `observatory build\|init` | Public OSS code-health observatory pipeline — clones, indexes, scores a configured repo list; writes static HTML + RSS + JSON to an output dir. v1.90.0; CI repo-id bug fixed in v1.90.1. Live at https://jgravelle.github.io/jcodemunch-observatory/ |

## Architecture Notes
- `index_folder` is **synchronous** — dispatched via `asyncio.to_thread()` in server.py to avoid blocking the event loop
- `index_repo` is **async** (uses httpx for GitHub API)
- `has_index()` distinguishes "no file on disk" from "file exists but version rejected"
- Symbol lookup is O(1) via `__post_init__` id dict in `CodeIndex`

## Custom Parsers
Tree-sitter grammar lacks clean named fields for these — custom regex extractors:
- **Erlang**: multi-clause function merging by (name, arity); arity-qualified names (e.g. `add/2`)
- **Fortran**: module-as-container, qualified names (`math_utils::multiply`), parameter constants
- **SQL**: `_parse_sql_symbols` + `sql_preprocessor.py` strips Jinja (dbt); macro/test/snapshot/materialization as symbols
- **Razor/Blazor** (.cshtml/.razor): `@functions/@code` → C#, `@page`/`@inject` → constants, HTML ids

| `JCODEMUNCH_SUMMARIZER_MODEL` | — | Model name override for the selected summarizer provider |
| `JCODEMUNCH_TRUSTED_FOLDERS` | — | Roots trusted for index_folder; whitelist mode by default |
| `JCODEMUNCH_EXTRA_IGNORE_PATTERNS` | — | Always-on gitignore patterns (comma-sep or JSON array) |
| `JCODEMUNCH_PATH_MAP` | — | Cross-platform path remapping; format: `orig1=new1,orig2=new2` |

| `JCODEMUNCH_MAX_RESULTS` | 500 | Hard cap on search_columns result count |
| `JCODEMUNCH_HTTP_TOKEN` | — | Bearer token for HTTP transport auth (opt-in) |
| `JCODEMUNCH_RATE_LIMIT` | 0 | Max requests/minute per client IP in HTTP transport (0 = disabled) |
| `JCODEMUNCH_REDACT_SOURCE_ROOT` | 0 | Set 1 to replace source_root with display_name in responses |
| `JCODEMUNCH_SHARE_SAVINGS` | 1 | Set 0 to disable anonymous token savings telemetry |
| `JCODEMUNCH_REDACT_RESPONSE_SECRETS` | 1 | Set 0 to disable response-level secret redaction (AWS/GCP/Azure/JWT/etc.) |
| `JCODEMUNCH_STATS_FILE_INTERVAL` | 3 | Calls between session_stats.json writes; 0 = disable |
| `JCODEMUNCH_PERF_TELEMETRY` | 0 | Set 1 to enable persistent perf SQLite sink at ~/.code-index/telemetry.db (per-tool latency + ok flag + repo). In-memory ring is always tracked; the env var only controls durable persistence. |

## Maintenance Practices

1. **Document every tool before shipping.** Any PR adding a new tool to `server.py`
   must simultaneously update: README.md (tool reference), CLAUDE.md (Key Files),
   CHANGELOG.md, and at least one test.
2. **Log every silent exception.** Every `except Exception:` block must emit at
   minimum `logger.debug("...", exc_info=True)`. For user-facing fallbacks (AI
   summarizer, index load), use `logger.warning(...)`.
3. **CHANGELOG.md** is the authoritative version history — update it with every release.
